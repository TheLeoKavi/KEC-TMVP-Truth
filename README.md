# KEC-TMVP Truth

This is how it started, with screenshots for proof.

1. I showed openly and honestly what I wanted. I labeled the Landmark “*Future* Strike”, so **my team would not attack before talks**, and a “Stop” pin, so they would **not go further** if we did get the landmark. I also explained why I thought it would be good for both of us. I expected a negotiation:
2. I pointed out that (at that time) we were evenly matched and should not fight.
3. In response, *[KEC]Leader threatened me*.
4. I tried to clarify Since [KEC]Leader clearly misunderstood my intentions.
5. **[KEC]Leader made a threatening demand**.

6. I showed a **proposal** (**not a demand**) for **peace and mutual benefit**.
7. Then I asked for clarification about the apparent threat from [KEC]Leader, and **restated I wanted peace**, but would fight **if necessary**. I hoped we could understand each other and negotiate something fair.
8. Then **I directly asked if they would allow peace**.

9. [KEC]Leader stated, "If you wanted peace, you should have contacted
me before building the club." **Notice**: **[KEC]Leader essentially declared war** at this point, for my "building the club", not for anything violent or aggressive.
10. I tried once again to clarify my proposal and why I thought it would be good for both of us.
11. I asked if we could make a deal based on my proposal, and then I went offline shortly after this.

12. When I came back online six hours later, [KEC]Leader had gained over $300,000,000 in finance and had attacked me and my team multiple times.
13. [KEC]Leader then began lying about it all to the public city chat.

Now, every time I'm offline for a few hours I come back to this:

This should put to bed any doubts that [KEC]Leader is a **liar, a belligerent, and a coward**.

Cheers!
